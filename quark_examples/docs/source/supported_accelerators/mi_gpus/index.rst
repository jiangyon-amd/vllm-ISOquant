Quark for AMD Instinct Accelerators
===================================

Depending on the GPU to be used, different quantization schemes may or may not have accelerated support in the underlying hardware.

On all GPUs supported by PyTorch, quantized models can be evaluated using fake quantization (quantize-dequantize), effectively using a higher widely supported precision for compute (e.g.,  ``float16``).

.. note::

    As an example, AMD Instinct MI300 supports ``float8`` compute, which means that linear layers quantized in ``float8`` for both the activation and weights may use ``float8 @ float8 -> float16`` computation.

    AMD Instinct MI325 also supports ``float8`` compute similar to MI300, enabling efficient ``float8 @ float8 -> float16`` computation for quantized models.

    AMD Instinct MI355 supports both ``float8`` and ``mxfp4`` (Microscaling FP4) compute, providing additional flexibility for ultra-low precision quantization with ``mxfp4 @ mxfp4`` computation.

    On the other hand, Instinct MI210 and Instinct MI250 GPUs (CDNA2 architecture) do not support ``float8`` computations, and only ``QDQ`` can be used for this specific ``dtype`` and hardware.

Below are some references on how you can leverage Quark to seamlessly run accelerated quantized models on AMD Instinct GPUs:
